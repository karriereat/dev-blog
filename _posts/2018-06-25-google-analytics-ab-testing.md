A/B testing allows you to continually improve your product's user experience or various sales/marketing KPIs, as long as your goals are well-defined and you have a clear hypothesis. This article does not tell you why you should do A/B testing, but focuses on how to implement tracking its results using JavaScript and Google Analytics.

The article is written for developers, marketing and product managers. If you are not a developer, feel free to skip the coding part and only read the first and third sections!

## 1. Test Definition

First you should define your A and B (even C?) versions and your conversion goal. 

The example A/B test we'll do in this example has a `Version A` and a `Version B`, with no difference other than their names, and we want visitors to click on the `Call to action` button.

To evaluate the test we therefore have to track three events:
1. A visitor viewing version A
2. A visitor viewing version B
3. A visitor clicking the `Call to action` button.

The conversion event (3) is a basic Google Analytics [Event](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033068), made up of a __category__, __action__ and optional __label__ component. Their values depend on how you want to manage your events in Google Analytics and are entirely up to you. 

In the example A/B test each component has a value of the same name:

Component | Value
- | - 
Category | `Category`
Action | `Action`
Label | `Label` 

You can send also events for the visitor viewing version A (1) or B (2). We did so for _karriere.at_ in the past, and it looked like this:

Component | Value
- | - 
Category | `ab-test`
Action | `test-name`
Label | `version-a`

Component | Value
- | - 
Category | `ab-test`
Action | `test-name`
Label | `version-b`

This solution works reliably, however in this article I want to propose another approach: __virtual pageviews__. A virtual pageview is like a real pageview, but the URL is made up, hence virtual. 

In the example A/B test the pageview URLs are as follows:

Page | URL (Path)
- | - 
Page containing A/B test | `/google-analytics-ab-testing`
Version A | `/virtual/A`
Version B | `/virtual/B`

This means that for each request two pageviews are send to Google Analytics: the original pageview of `/google-analytics-ab-testing` and, depending on the version that is served to the user, either `/virtual/A` or `/virtual/B`. 

Why virtual pageviews? I feel it makes talking about the A/B test easier, as you would normally use phrases like 

> How many visitors viewed the red landing page?
 
as opposed to:
 
> How many events in the 'A/B test' category with a 'summer campaign' action and the 'red landing page' label have been tracked?

<small>
Beware, that the virtual pageviews are collected additionally to the normal pageview, so your visits will get "inflated". For this and many other reasons you should create a new view for all of your A/B tests and add a [filter](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033162?hl=en) to exclude virtual pageviews (`/virtual/A`) in your original view.
</small> 

## 2. JavaScript Implementation

The test definition gets handed over to the developer, who sets up the code and sends the data to Google Analytics.

The code for the example A/B test is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/karriereat/google-analytics-ab-testing) and can be adapted to your needs. The tracking implementation has four tasks:

* Deliver version A to 50% of clients, and version B to the other 50% of clients
* Deliver the same version to a client on each subsequent page load
* Send virtual pageviews, tracking the version a client has received
* Sending conversion events when clicking the `Call to action` button

If you copy the snippet from [analytics.js](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/) it already sends the normal pageview with `ga('send', 'pageview');`:

```html
<script>
    // ...
    ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
    ga('send', 'pageview');
</script>
<script async src='https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js'></script>
```

You can immediately test the pageview by opening your browser's developer tools and heading to the network tab:

![](/assets/images/google-analytics-ab-testing/network-tab-pageview-request.png)

In this example the visitor is assigned a version randomly, which is then stored via `localStorage` on the client. 

<small>
You can do the same on the server with cookies of course, depending on your needs -- you might for example choose to segmentize users based on their IDs.
</small>

```js
function getVersion() {
    return localStorage.getItem('version') || (Math.random() >= 0.5 ? 'A' : 'B');
}
function setVersion(value) {
    localStorage.setItem('version', value);
}
```

When you know the visitor's version you can immediately send a virtual pageview with `ga('send', ...);`:

```js
function sendVirtualPageview(version) {
    ga('send', {
        hitType: 'pageview',
        page: `/virtual/${version}`
    });
    // ga('send', 'pageview',`/${this.version}`)
}
```

The conversion event, which has to be fired when clicking the `Call to action` button, is also sent via `ga('send', ...);`:

```js
function sendConversionEvent() {
    ga('send', {
        hitType: 'event',
        eventCategory: 'Category',
        eventAction: 'Action',
        eventLabel: 'Label'
    });
    // ga('send', 'event', 'Category', 'Action', 'Label');
}
```

## 3. Google Analytics Report

You can start to setup the A/B test report in Google Analytics simultaneously to the tracking implementation, or afterwards. However, if the implementation is already done you can check if the pageviews and events have been correctly collected by Google Analytics.

To check the pageviews you can open up any content report (even real-time, if you just finished implementation and the data hasn't been processed yet, which can take up to a few hours) and search for `virtual`. This will show you all virtual pageviews collected in the specified timeframe:

![](/assets/images/google-analytics-ab-testing/report-virtual-pageviews.png) 

You can also verify the conversion event by going to the behavoir category and searching for your event (either by category, action or label):

![](/assets/images/google-analytics-ab-testing/report-events.png) 

For your report you'll now have to create what's called [Segments](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3123951) and a [Goal](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012040?hl=en) in Google Analytics.

The goal can be created by going to the admin section and selecting goals in the view column (third column). 

![](/assets/images/google-analytics-ab-testing/goal-creation-step-1.png)

I have named the goal `Conversion` and set its type to event. You then have to enter the details of the event and save the goal. If you want you can use __Verify this Goal__ to have Google Analytics check for any existing events that match your settings. 

![](/assets/images/google-analytics-ab-testing/goal-creation-step-2.png)

You can now select any report in Google Analytics and select the newly defined `Conversion` goal and its various metrics. You can for example go to __Channels__ in the __Acquisition__ section and select goal completions. It will show you how often the `Call to action` button has been clicked in total:

![](/assets/images/google-analytics-ab-testing/goal-completions.png)

What you now want to do is get the number of clicks that happened in each version of your A/B test. For this to happen you have to add two segments via the __+ Add Segment__ button. The only thing you have to set, besides giving it a meaningful name, is the page you want to filter:

![](/assets/images/google-analytics-ab-testing/segment-creation.png)

With your report properly set up you should now see the conversions per version. You can save your report for later or export it in various formats to for example send it to your data analyst to check statistical significance (or use one of the many online [calculators](https://vwo.com/ab-split-test-significance-calculator/)).

Of course the date from the example A/B test isn't very exciting, which is why I want to conclude this article with a report of an actual A/B/C test that we've did at _karriere.at_, so you can see what it looks like with real numbers:
